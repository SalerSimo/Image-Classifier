# **Image Classifier**

##Project description
**Image Classifier** is a deep learning-based project designed to classify images into predefined categories. This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically identify and classify images based on their visual features. The classifier is built using Python, with libraries like TensorFlow/Keras, and is trained on a labeled dataset to achieve high accuracy.

With **Image Classifier** it is possible to:
- Use existing models to classify images
- Train a new model, simply knowing the categories of the model 

##Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SalerSimo/Image-Classifier.git
    cd Image-Classifier
2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt```
##Usage
1. Open file "**launch.cmd**" or write in the command line:
    ```bash
    python source/main.py
